## Netlify config removed
# This file previously contained Netlify-specific deployment configuration.
# Deployment configuration was intentionally removed per project request to
# keep the repository focused on local development. If you want to re-add
# hosting configuration for Netlify later, restore the appropriate build
# and redirect settings here.
